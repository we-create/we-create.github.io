		<p>   Welcome to we_create's website! We are a small Arduino user group based in Collegedale, Tennessee. We host collaborative projects that we post on the Arduino project hub, Arduino IDE development, occasional group meetups, product reviews, and more. We put our main focus on offering tutorials, building with the IoT, and helping our environment with the use of Arduino, although we also use participate in robotics and smart home building.</p>
		<p>   We use mostly Arduino, although sometimes we will hook it up with other hardware such as Raspberry Pi, Amazon Echo and other Alexa-compatible items, ESP8266's, and more. Our goal is to help the world become a better place through Arduino while keeping in line with the Arduino User Groups Manifesto.</p>
